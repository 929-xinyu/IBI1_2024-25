Response to Feedback:

Thank you for the detailed feedback on my work for Weeks 3, 4, and 5. I appreciate the clear breakdown of marks and the constructive comments provided. Below is my response to the feedback and how I plan to address the areas for improvement:

1.Week 3:
   I am pleased to see that I achieved full marks for this week and no changes was neccessary.

2.Week 4:  
   variables.py:
     The feedback notes that the comparison result between variables was not stated. I will ensure that future code includes clear output statements or comments to explicitly show the results of such comparisons. Additionally, I will include a full truth table in the comments to meet the requirements fully.  
   mystery_code.py:
     I acknowledge that the description of the codeâ€™s functionality was incomplete. I will add a more detailed pseudocode that shows the numbers are between 1 and 6.

3.Week 5:
   I am happy to have achieved full marks for this week and no changes was neccessary.

Thank you again for the feedback. I will use it to improve my work and aim for even better results in the coming weeks.
